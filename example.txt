There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. 
One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. 
Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, 
the hare thought he’d win this easily. 
So, he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going.
 When the hare woke, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. 
 Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.

Moral of the story:

There are a couple of moral lessons we can learn from this story. 
The hare teaches that overconfidence can sometimes ruin you. 
While the tortoise teaches us about the power of perseverance. 
Even if all the odds are stacked against you, never give up. 
Sometimes, life is not about who’s the fastest or the strongest; it’s about who is the most consistent.
